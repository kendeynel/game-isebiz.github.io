        ABOUT GAME!
      </h1>
    </header>

    <p>Here at GAME!, we love games. We love games so much that we decided to devote our lives to give games
    to you. We do more than just give games to you. We make getting games from us such a pleasant experience
    that it will be hard to get from anywhere else(except Steam since they do their own thing. Steam's cool).</p>

    <p>The idea for this website started around 15 years ago when our lead gamer Ken got frustrated when
    he went with his parents to buy a game at Blockbuster(back when they were still selling their exclusive
    but terrible quality games). Quality of the games aside, the pricing was atrocious and the purchasing
    experience was one of the worst he has ever experienced in his life. Even as a 5 year old kid, he could
    tell that the cashier lady was quite mean and inflexible. Ever since then, he decided that he would somehow
    find a way to defeat the Blockbuster overlords and acquire games in a pleasant and reasonable ways. When
    Blockbuster died on its own(a.k.a they didn't buy Netflix) Ken rejoiced with a laugh that would even be
    heard by species from a different galaxy. However, he still had one more mission and that is to make the
    world have a better game purchasing experience. Over the years he has met other people that share the same
    ambition as him and with their own terrible Blockbuster experiences to boot(Netflix FTW).</p>
